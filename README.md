# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Project status
Development for this project is on pause, for now.

## Description
A challenge for myself to build a basic portfolio page, relying almost entirely on bootstrap styling. The aim was to see if an affinity with the toolkit makes writing web-code faster and opens up new styles and inspiration for me with page design. The page showcases my skills aquired to date, my completed projects and different ways to find out more about me and my work. As with my 'responsive-portfolio' project (see repo), it is just a shell of a portfolio, but it is designed and written to be accessible, adaptable and alterable as my projects and skillsets evolve. It provides links to specific projects and the skills involved in making them. It uses many features of bootstrap, from basic spacing and colours, to eliminating the need for personalised @media queries, all by using bootstrap's class systems.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
The title shows the name of the student whose portfolio it is. The header bar features links which can be used to navigate the sections within the page, including an 'About Me' section, a previous work section and a section with modes of contacting the student. Navigating to each section, the sections are expanded upon with content, visual aids and links. The web application has been adapted to be used at different viewport scales, from monitors & laptops, to tablets, to mobile phones.

## Contributing
As this is a personal project, designed to challenge and test my skills, I am not currently looking for contributors. However, there may be a opening for this in the future.
